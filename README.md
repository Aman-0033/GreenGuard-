# 🌍 GreenGuard – Cybersecurity for a Greener World

**GreenGuard** is a smart cybersecurity system that monitors energy-powered IoT devices in real time.  
It detects unusual energy usage (spikes, drops, or slow drifts), prevents attacks, and reduces waste.  

By saving electricity, it also cuts CO₂ emissions — proving that protecting devices means protecting the planet.

## ✨ Features
- Real-time IoT energy monitoring (simulated data stream)
- Dual anomaly detection:
  - **Z-Threshold** for sudden spikes
  - **EWMA** for gradual drifts
- Live dashboard with:
  - Current energy signal (kW)
  - Anomalies detected
  - CO₂ saved
  - Security alerts
- Demo mode to inject test anomalies
- Tunable detection parameters

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Flask backend)
- **JavaScript + Chart.js** (frontend visualization)
- **HTML/CSS** (UI)
- **Threading** for continuous data simulation

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
